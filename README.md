<h3>Languages I Am Learning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java - I have become far too familiar with Java but I'm sure I will never stop learning new quirks</li>
  <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript - Web development has interested me for a long time and I have slowly been practicing</li>
  <li>Rust - I really like rust but don't use often because I still struggle with it and it has slow compile times</li>
  <li>Python - I'm not too keen on Python but I have been learning it because it is a commonly used language and is good to know</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing Words</h3>
